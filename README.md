# Infrastructure as Code

Welcome to this module, Infrastructure as Code (IaC). I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11.&#x20;

I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started.&#x20;

I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it.

This module is intended as a foundation module and has minimal prerequisites. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn.&#x20;

If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my "Getting Started notes in Week 1 to understand what you need.
