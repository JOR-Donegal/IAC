# Week 4

I need you to begin to understand academic writing. Review my note on [academic reports](https://app.gitbook.com/o/QPfy4AwGQImQTS0uxR0R/s/Ln5NN2lLLiBBdr87ld9c/) and download my template. Document the work below as an academic report.

I want you to be able to work seamlessly between your Windows host and your Linux VM. For that reason, we will install tools on both environments. If you are working in a University lab, these are already installed. Keep the records of your work in a laboratory report. Create a folder called Week 3 in your repo and when complete, upload your report in a PDF format.

I have stopped giving detailed notes for doing these installs, as the process can change from year to year. And at L9, it is really much better if you figure these out for yourself.

This week I need you to install on your host computer

1. Python (latest version)
2. GitHub and GitHub desktop. Link your repo to GitHub desktop and sync a local copy of Week1 and Week2.
3. Notepad++
4. Visual Studio Code (VSC)
5. Putty
6. WinSCP

Using the clone of your desktop VM **ub2404-Development1**.&#x20;

1. It is easiest if you access this via RDP, not via VMWare Workstation. Test that you can do that.

On this VM, install (or verify if already installed)

1. Python
2. OpenSSH Server
3. GitHub and GitHub desktop. For the desktop tool, I used instructions I found [here](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-via-package-manager). Link your repo to GitHub desktop. Do some reading with regard to a tool to authorize a Linux server from the command line (**gh auth login**) and install **gh**. Link your repo to GitHub desktop and sync a local copy of Week1 and Week2.
4. Visual Studio Code (VSC). The home repo is [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), and in the readme, I found a [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to the main website with installation instructions.

Finally!

See if you can connect from your host computer to **ub2404-Development1** using SSH and WinSCP.
