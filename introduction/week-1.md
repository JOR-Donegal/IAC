# Week 1

Go through my [Getting Started](https://app.gitbook.com/o/QPfy4AwGQImQTS0uxR0R/s/WV8s0r99HUGRyM15Pqxl/) notes before doing anything else.&#x20;

I need you to be able to use a basic virtualization technology before we can continue.&#x20;

This week, go through my notes on using [VMWare Workstation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/QPfy4AwGQImQTS0uxR0R/s/OCCmaJBQU9gxcvffQxIZ/).

As you are going on, record what you are doing. Your records should be sufficient that you can recreate the work with no other assistance.&#x20;

In week 2, you will put these notes into a particular format and make them accessible to me and you have some VMs to work with.
