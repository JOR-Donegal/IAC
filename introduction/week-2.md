# Week 2

The next skill you need is a basic ability to use GitHub. I no longer provide my own notes for this. The aim is to give you basic competence to create and consume material on GitHub. I am not trying to make you into developers, but scripters; developers light!

1. At the [GitHub skills site](https://skills.github.com/), run through the [first day on GitHub](https://skills.github.com/#first-day-on-github) exercises. Create an account as Lxxxxxxx, where the account name is your L Number. On completion, you should understand the basics and also, how to use markdown.
2. Create a repo called **IaC**. This is where you will submit all your material for this module. Make sure the repo is private, then send your lecturer an invite as a contributor.
3. Create a r**eadme.md** file, you will update this throughout the module, I will give some guidelines as to what I expect the anatomy to be.
4. In the repo **IaC**, create a folder called **Week1**. Convert your notes from week 1 into a markdown format and copy them up to this folder. &#x20;
5. In the repo **IaC**, create a folder called **Week2**. Copy up a cheat-sheet of Git command AND a cheat sheet of markdown elements to this folder.  Both documents should use well structured markdown.
