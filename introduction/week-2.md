# Week 3

The next skill you need is a basic ability to use GitHub. I no longer provide my own practical notes for this. However, read [this primer](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/iac/version-control) to get an idea of the context.

The aim is to give you basic competence to create and consume material on GitHub. I am not trying to make you into developers, but scripters; developers light!

1. Clone your Ubuntu Desktop and call it **ub2404-Development1**, use that for these exercises.
   1. Configure it in the NAT'd subnet and make sure you can sketch the network. As always, test!
   2. Do updates and document in the description box.&#x20;
   3. Change the hostname to ub2404-Development1 and give it an appropriate static IP address.
2. Create an account on GITHUB as Lxxxxxxx, where the account name is your L Number.&#x20;
3. At the [GitHub skills site](https://skills.github.com/), run through the [first day on GitHub](https://skills.github.com/#first-day-on-github) exercises. You will use markdown throughout this course of study. On completion, you should understand the basics and also, how to use markdown. Apologies for Mona the cat!
4. Create a repo called **IaC**. This is where you will submit all your material for this module. Make sure the repo is private, then send your lecturer an invite as a contributor.
5. Create a **README.md** file, you will update this throughout this module, I will give some [guidelines ](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/iac/python-for-cloud-scripters/12.-projects/markdown)as to what I expect the anatomy to be.
6. In the repo **IaC**, create a folder called **Week2**. Convert your notes from week 2 into a markdown format and copy them up to this folder. This should be c. 50 lines or so, no screenshots.&#x20;
7. In the repo **IaC**, create a folder called **Week3**. Copy up a cheat-sheet of Git command AND a cheat sheet of markdown elements to this folder.  Both documents should use well structured markdown.

Remember, when you submit work in GITHUB, you need to make a submission of the link through Blackboard.
