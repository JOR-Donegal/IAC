# Week 2

Go through my [Getting Started](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/iac/getting-started) notes before doing anything else. These notes are the same for each module, so if you have gone through these on one of my previous modules, all good.  Next read my very basic [background](https://app.gitbook.com/o/QPfy4AwGQImQTS0uxR0R/s/Nttic2PELKMDcU8y9RIw/) to computing. &#x20;

I need you to be able to use a basic virtualization technology before we can continue. This week, go through my notes on using [VMWare Workstation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/QPfy4AwGQImQTS0uxR0R/s/OCCmaJBQU9gxcvffQxIZ/).

As you are going on, record what you are doing. Your records should be sufficient that you can recreate the work with no other assistance.&#x20;

In week 2, you will put these notes into a particular format and make them accessible to me.  And after this, you will have some VMs to work with.

Your attention to detail is very important. If I tell you to name something, follow my instructions exactly.&#x20;
