# Week 7

This week, we are going to work at the command prompt again! This time using PowerShell as our environment.

When we are working on OS scripting, we need to begin by being able to work at the command prompt and then move on to creating reusable scripts based on our knowledge of the underlying commands. Run through [these notes and exercises](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/iac/powershell).

Begin by understanding how to use the PowerShell command prompt and a basic editor (ISE).

Then move on to automating this by creating and executing script files. Personalize these script files, change the names, dates and adjust how they work. For the first time, we will attempt configuration at scale.

Create a folder called PowerShell in your repo and when complete, upload your report in a PDF format. Each script file should be included in an appendix, along with a screen shot of it running.
