# Week 8-10

We are going to spend the next few weeks learning a first serious programming language, Python. I'm trying to make you a competent scripter, not a professional programmer. At the end of this sequence, you should be able to automate many standard tasks.

We will use Visual Studio Code and run through a family of examples. As always, you will record these examples and save them to GITHUB, in a directory called **Python**.&#x20;

There are 12 sections in [my Python notes](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/iac/python-for-cloud-scripters), create a directory under **\Python** for each section.

Put scripts into the root of that directory. Put screenshots of the outcome/test in a subdirectory called **Images**

I use the **tree** command as an example to show you what I mean.

```
C:\Users\John.ORaw\Python>tree /F
Folder PATH listing for volume OS
Volume serial number is B455-5378
C:.
├───Ex1
│   │   add.py
│   │   budget.py
│   │   slicing.py
