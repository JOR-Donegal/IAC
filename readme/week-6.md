# Week 6

This week, we are going to work at the command prompt and get the first scripting done, all in a Linux environment.

When we are working on OS scripting, we need to begin by being able to work at the command prompt and then move on to creating reusable scripts based on our knowledge of the underlying commands.

Begin by understanding [how to use the command prompt](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/iac/linux-command-line).

Then move on to[ automating this](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/iac/automating-linux) by creating and executing script files. Personalize these script files, change the names, dates and adjust how they work.

Create a folder called Linux in your repo and when complete, upload your report in a PDF format. Each script file should be included in an appendix, along with a screen shot of it running.
