# Week 5

This week, we are going to work at the command prompt and get the first scripting done, all in a DOS environment.&#x20;

When we are working on OS scripting, we need to begin by being able to work at the command prompt and then move on to creating reusable scripts based on our knowledge of the underlying commands.

Begin by understanding how to use the [command prompt](https://app.gitbook.com/o/QPfy4AwGQImQTS0uxR0R/s/171baNJSmfHdbpzOrDiT/).

Then move on to automating this by creating and executing [batch files](https://app.gitbook.com/o/QPfy4AwGQImQTS0uxR0R/s/4Q4hTRkjEUR4uXPy4TCb/). Personalise these batch files, change the names, dates and adjust how they work.

Create a folder called DOS in your repo and when complete, upload your report in a PDF format. Each batch file should be included in an appendix, along with a screen shot of it running.
