# Week 11

In previous notes you have looked at the basics of scripting and coding for automation in several environments. You have seen DOS, Linux, and PowerShell.&#x20;

You have seen DSC, which showed you how to automate at scale in a Windows environment.

In these notes we will look at [automating at scale in a heterogenous environment](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/iac/automation). After doing the background reading, build a [basic Ansible test environment](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/iac/ansible).&#x20;

After gaining competence with Ansible, you will be able to automate orchestration, provisioning, configuration, application deployment and updates, all at scale.&#x20;

You could do all of this using scripts, but Ansible is normally more efficient, saving the need to learn every vendor's domain specific language (DSL).

Read through the [ansible site documentation](https://www.ansible.com/) to familiarize yourself.&#x20;

Create a folder called Ansible in your repo and when complete, upload your report in a PDF format. Each playbook should be included in an appendix, along with a screen shot of it running.

Remember, when you submit work in GITHUB, you need to make a submission of the link through Blackboard.
