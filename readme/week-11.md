# Week 11

In previous notes you have looked at the basics of scripting and coding for automation in several environments. You have seen DOS, Linux, and PowerShell.&#x20;

You have seen DSC, which showed you how to automate at scale in a Windows environment.

In these notes we will look at automating at scale in a heterogenous environment. After gaining competence with Ansible, you will be able to automate orchestration, provisioning, configuration, application deployment and updates, all at scale.&#x20;

You could do all of this using scripts, but Ansible is normally more efficient, saving the need to learn every vendor's domain specific language (DSL).

Read through the [ansible site documentation](https://www.ansible.com/) to familiarize yourself.&#x20;
