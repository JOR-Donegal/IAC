# Finally

That's it, you are done!

We covered so many fundamental scripting skills in this module. While you were at it, you learned how to use desktop virtualization, how to interact between Linux and Windows and how to do version control.

When you think you are complete, go back and make sure you have uploaded everything to GITHUB. Remember, when you submit work in GITHUB, you need to make a submission of the link through Blackboard.

Congratulations on getting this far.&#x20;
